        Not a bad manoeuvre. I mind; it about time for the one interesting event of the day to occur, so I will watch for myself, thank you," and Lennox took the easy chair by the window with a shrug and a yawn.
"I am glad any thing does interest you," said Kate, petulantly, "though I dont think it amounts to much, for, though you perch yourself at the window every day to see that girl pass, you dont care enough about it to ask her name."
"I have been waiting to be told."
"Its Belle Morgan, the Doctors daughter, and my dearest friend."
"Then, of course, she is a blue-belle?"
"Dont try to be witty or sarcastic with her, for she will beat you at that."
"Not a dumb-belle then?"
"Quite the reverse; she talks a good deal, and very well too, when she likes."
"She is very pretty; has anybody the right to call her Ma belle?"
"Many would be glad to do so, but she wont have any thing to say to them."
"A Canterbury belle in every sense of the word then?"

"She might be, for all Canterbury loves her, but she isnt fashionable, and has more friends among the poor than among the rich."
"Ah, I see, a diving-bell, who knows how to go down into a sea of troubles, and bring up the pearls worth having."
"I will tell her that, it will please her. You are really waking up, Harry," and Kate smiled approvingly upon him.
"This page of Belles Life is rather amusing, so read away," said Lennox, glancing up the street, as if he awaited the appearance of the next edition with pleasure.
"There isnt much to tell; she is a nice, bright, energetic, warm-hearted dear; the pride of the Doctors heart, and a favorite with every one, though she is odd.
"How odd?"
"Does and says what she likes, is very blunt and honest, has ideas and principles of her own, goes to parties in high dresses, wont dance round dances, and wears red stockings, though Mrs. Plantagenet says its fast."
"Rather a jolly little person, I fancy. Why havent we met her at some of the tea-fights and muffin-worries we have been to lately?"
"It may make you angry, but it will do you good, so I will tell. She didnt care enough about seeing the distinguished stranger to come; thats the truth."
"Sensible girl, to spare herself hours of mortal dulness, gossip, and dyspepsia," was the placid reply.
"She has seen you, though, at church and dawdling about town, and she called you 'Sir Charles Coldstream on the spot.
        How does that suit?" asked Kate, maliciously.
"Not bad, I rather like that. Wish she would call some day, and stir us up."
"She wont; I asked her, but she said she was very busy, and told Jessy Tudor, she wasnt fond of peacocks. Then there was a time where nothing could
        becomprimised due to the grandmother.
        Last year, I put together this list of the most iconic poems in the English language; it’s high time to do the same for short stories. But before we go any further,
        you may be asking: What does “iconic” mean in this context? Can a short story really be iconic in the way of a poem, or a painting, or Elvis?

Well, who knows, but for our purposes, iconic means that the story has somehow wormed its way into the general cultural consciousness—a list of the best short stories in the English language would look quite different than the one below.
        (Also NB that in this case we are necessarily talking about the American cultural consciousness, weird and wiggly as it is.) When something is
        iconic, it is a highly recognizable cultural artifact that can be used as a shorthand—which often means it has been referenced in other forms of media. You know, just like Elvis. (So for those of you heading to the comments to complain that these stories are
        the usual suspects—well, exactly.) An iconic short story may be frequently anthologized, which usually means frequently read in classrooms, something that can lead to cultural ubiquity—but interestingly, the correlation isnt perfect. For instance, Joyce’s “Araby” is anthologized more often, but for my money “The Dead” is more iconic. Film adaptations and catchy, reworkable titles help. But in the end, for better or for worse, you know it when you see it. Which means that, like anything else, it all depends on your point of view—icon status is (like most of the ways we evaluate art) highly subjective."
